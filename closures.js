//Once you complete a problem, open up Chrome and check the answer in the console.

  var name = 'Tyler';

//Above you're given a function that returns another function which has a closure over the name variable.
//Invoke outer saving the return value into another variable called 'inner'.

  //Code Here
var inner = outer();
//Once you do that, invoke inner.

  //Code Here
inner();

//Above you're given a callFriend function that returns another function.
//Do what you need to do in order to call your function and get 'Calling Jake at 435-215-9248' in your console.

/*
  Write a function called makeCounter that makes the following code work properly.
*/

  //Code Here
  var count = makeCounter();
  count() // 1
  count() // 2
  count() // 3
  count() // 4



//Next Problem



/*
  Write a function that accepts another function as it's first argument and returns a new function
  (which invokes the original function that was passed in) that can only ever be executed once.
*/

  //Code Here



//Next Problem



/*
  Now, similar to the last problem, write a function called 'fnCounter' that accepts two parameters. The first parameter will be an anonymous function and the second parameter, 'N', will be a number. Now, in 'fnCounter', allow the anonymous funciton to be invoked 'N' number of times. After it's been invoked 'N' number of times, return 'STOP'.
*/



//Next Problem



/*
  var counter = function(){
    for (var i=1; i<=5; i++) {
      setTimeout( function timer(){
          console.log( i );
      }, i*1000 );
    }
  };

  Above you have a function named counter. Examine the function (without running the code) then below write what you expect to happen when the funciton is invoked. *Hint: setTimeout calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds.

    //Answer Here


  Now, run the function in your console and note what happpens.

  Was your answer right or wrong?

    //Answer Here


  Fix the counter function so that it works the way you expect it to work. (logging 1 then 2 then 3, etc)
